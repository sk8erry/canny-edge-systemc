## Modeling of a Canny Edge Detector for Embedded Systems Design
In this project I created an embedded system model for Canny Edge Detection using SystemC based on the C program written by Mike Heath (heath@csee.usf.edu). This project implemented a top down approach and separated computational modules from communicational modules. I removed inefficient dynamic memory allocation and rewrote pieces of program for C++ compatibility. Each stages of the algorithm was divided into SystemC modules and pipelining / parallelization was implemented for better performance. The final result achieved a much higher throughput (measured in FPS) and can potentially be used for real-time image processing.
